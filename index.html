        I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hguo/">Heng Guo</a>.
        I completed my undergraduate degree at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu">University of California at Santa Cruz</a>.

        My research interests lie in algorithms and complexity for counting and sampling problems. 
        A list of preprints and publications can be found <a href="research.html">here</a>.

            When not at a desk, I can generally be found doing some sort of recreational athletic activity.

            Probably <a href="https://wfdf.sport/disciplines/ultimate/">Ultimate</a>, but I also enjoy cycling, climbing, hiking, and Scottish dance. 
            It also takes very little to persuade me to try other sports.
